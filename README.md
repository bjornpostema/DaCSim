This Data Centre Simulation Framework (DaCSim) has been developed using the multi-method simulation software AnyLogic. The purpose of this framework is providing useful insight in decision making in energy and performance metrics for a wide variety of data centre configuration. DaCSim requires AnyLogic (v8.1.0) to be able to operate. DaCSim has been used in academia and succesfully applied to a company case study.
